# Employee Project Report Submission System
The Employee Project Report Submission System is designed to allow employees to submit detailed reports of the projects they have worked on. The system facilitates an organized approach to track and manage project data, allowing employees to upload information about their work in a structured format. The system supports project details such as the project title, description, category, and images associated with the project. The following outlines the roles and functionality of the system:

# Key Features:

# Employee Report Submission:
Employees can fill out a form with the project title, description, and category.
They can upload images related to the project to provide additional context or results.
User Roles:

# Admin: 
The admin has the highest level of access and is responsible for overseeing the system. They can manage the submissions, view reports, and handle data across the platform.
# Employee: 
Employees use the system to submit their project reports. They are the primary users of the report submission feature.
# Client/Other Roles (optional): 
Depending on the system design, clients or other roles can also access the platform for different purposes, like viewing the submitted reports or requesting additional information.


# User Authentication:
Users (employees and admins) must log in to access their dashboards.
The login process uses a username and password, and users are assigned a role (admin, employee, etc.). Based on the role, users are redirected to specific pages (e.g., admin dashboard, employee dashboard).

# Logout Functionality:

A Logout button is provided to allow users to safely exit the system, which redirects them to the home page.

# Form Validation:

Input fields are validated to ensure that the necessary data (like employee name, project title, description, etc.) is provided before submission.
The user is prompted to correct any missing or invalid fields.

# Data Submission:

Once the employee submits the project report, the information is processed and stored. The admin can later access the report, review the submission, and take further action.
Roles in the System:

# Employee Role:

. Employees have access to the project report submission form.
. They can submit their project details (title, description, category, images).
. They can view their own submissions but cannot access others' reports.

# Admin Role:

. Admins have access to all project reports submitted by employees.
. They can review and manage the reports, ensuring data consistency.
. Admins may also have the ability to delete or modify submitted reports.

# Functionality Summary:
